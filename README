The USB Robot Controller Application is a Java application intended to make the
control of robots utilizing USB joysticks or game pads easier. Joystick can be
added to the library of available joysticks by writing joystick specific classes
an adding them to the library.

In many cases a user may not know what the functionality of a specific joystick
is. In this case the application has a characterization UI which shows the button
names and allows the user to manipulate them to get the device output values.
Again, after writing the necessary joystick specific class the application will
have access to it.

Output from the program is also user configurable. Since the intent is to control
connected robots, the output will require configuration. In this instance the
output is configured using XML files indicating what buttons will produce an 
output and what that output will be. This allows known joystick in the library
to produce different outputs based on the user created XML file.

Setup:
Initial setup of the application requires the executable jar file to be ran with
the libraries argument. This must be accomplished on the command line.
